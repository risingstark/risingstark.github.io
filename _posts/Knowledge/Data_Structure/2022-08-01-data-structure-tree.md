### Introduction
Data structures such as list(Arrays), linked list, stack and queue are linear data structures that data is stored sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. However, it is not acceptable in real life where we live in data flood.<br>

The different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure. In this part, I would like to introduce basic knowledge of a tree data structure.

<br>

### Tree Definition
**<ins>A tree is an abstract model and can be defined as a collection of entities called nodes linked together through edges in a hierarchical structure.</ins>** They don’t have any cyclic relations and there is only one path to a particular node.
<br>

- **Root**: the top (initial) node of the tree
- **Node**: an entity that hold key-value, representing as circle shape usually
- **Edge**: a connection of two nodes and a tree has N-1 edges (N = the number of nodes)
- **Parent**: a node which is a predecessor of any node
- **Child**: a node which is descendant of any node
- **Siblings**: a group of nodes which have the same parent
- **Leaf (terminal) node**: a node without children node
- **Level**: it is defined as 1 + the number of edges between the node and the root
- **Height**: the number of edges from its root to the furthest leaf
- **Depth**: the number of edges from the node to the tree’s root
- **Sub-tree**: a portion of a tree data structure that can be viewed as a complete tree in itself

<br>

### End
Tree is not only a well known data structure that loved from all software engineer but also basic concept to understand as a software engineer. It will follow you forever in software industry. So, Please make sure you understand and keep it as your best friend.
